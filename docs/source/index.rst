trrex: efficient keyword mining with regular expressions
==============================================================

The package includes a function that represents a collection of keywords (strings) as a regular expression. This regular expression
can be used for multiple purposes, such as keyword replacement, keyword extraction, fuzzy matching, and other similar tasks.

.. ipython:: python

    import re
    import trrex as tx

    pattern = tx.make(["baby", "bat", "bad"])
    re.findall(pattern, "The baby was scared by the bad bat.")
