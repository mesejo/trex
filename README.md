# Efficient string matching with regular expressions

This package includes a pure Python function that enables you to represent a set of strings as a regular expression.
With this regular expression, you can perform various operations, such as replacing, extracting and matching keywords.
The name of the package comes from the internal trie used to build the regular expression (**TR**ie to **RE**ge**X**)

## Install trrex

Use pip,

```bash
pip install trrex
```

## Usage

```python
import trrex as tx
import re

pattern = tx.make(['baby', 'bat', 'bad'])
hits = re.findall(pattern, 'The baby was scared by the bad bat.')
# hits = ['baby', 'bat', 'bad']
```

### pandas

```python
import trrex as tx
import pandas as pd

frame = pd.DataFrame({
    "txt": ["The baby", "The bat"]
})
pattern = tx.make(['baby', 'bat', 'bad'], prefix=r"\b(", suffix=r")\b") # need to specify capturing groups
frame["match"] = frame["txt"].str.extract(pattern)
hits = frame["match"].tolist()
print(hits)
# hits = ['baby', 'bad']
```

## Why use trrex?

- trrex builds a *better* regex pattern, than the simple regex union, therefore searching (and replacing) strings is
about 300 times faster than a regex union pattern, and about 2.5 times faster than FlashText algorithm. See below for a performance
comparison:

- Plays well with others, can be integrated easily with pandas, spacy and any other regex engine. See the [documentation](https://trrex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/integration.html)
for examples.
- Pure Python, no other dependencies
